# ⚔️ Leonidas Magnus Murphy

**Junior DevSecOps Engineer | Founder of [FurySec](https://github.com/FurySec)**  
Bridging the gap between code and defense — automating security across pipelines, clouds, and infrastructures.  

---

### 🧩 **Background**
Previously focused on **Red Teaming** and **Backend Engineering (Python/Django)**.  
I conducted penetration tests, simulated real-world adversaries, and developed secure backend systems.  
This journey shaped my transition toward **DevSecOps**, where development, security, and automation converge.  

---

### 🎯 **Current Focus**
I’m building end-to-end security pipelines that integrate directly into CI/CD workflows, ensuring systems are secure **by design** — not by patch.  
My focus areas include:  
- **DevSecOps Automation & Integration**  
- **Cloud & Container Security (AWS / Docker / Kubernetes)**  
- **CI/CD Pipeline Defense**  
- **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform / Ansible)**  
- **Threat Modeling & Continuous Hardening**

---

### ⚙️ **Tooling & Technologies**
**Languages:** Python, Bash, YAML  
**DevOps Tools:** Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, ArgoCD  
**Security Tools:** Trivy, Snyk, OWASP ZAP, SonarQube, Clair, Falco, Anchore, OPA  
**Infrastructure:** AWS, Terraform, Ansible, Nginx, Linux (Ubuntu, Kali, Arch)  
**Version Control:** Git, GitHub, GitLab  
**Monitoring & Automation:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Cron  

---

### 💡 **Why I Transitioned**
To transform security from a reactive control into a **continuous engineering discipline**.  
To embed automated defense mechanisms inside delivery pipelines.  
To merge the **warrior’s mindset** with the **engineer’s precision** — ensuring every deployment is resilient.
